This library provides a simple way to create barcodes using only the Python standardlib. The barcodes are created as SVG objects. Optional PIL support is included (barcodes as PNG, JPG, ...).

This project will be moved to bitbucket.org to provide downloads in the future. All further development takes place there. Downloads and open issues will be moved soon.
